## Contributions

If you would like to contribute to Sneedtris, please feel free to submit a pull request. All contributions are welcome but the following things are what I would personally like to see added to the game:

- [ ] A way to display your score
- [ ] A way to make the 'j'-key speed down the current tetrimino
- [ ] A Sneed's Feed and Seed (Formerly Chuck's) reference
